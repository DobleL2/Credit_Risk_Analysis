## Project Summary
The fintech ecosystem has experienced rapid growth in recent years and established itself as a key actor to meet the demands and needs of financial consumers. Growth was fueled by increasing demand for financial services not provided by the traditional financial sector, and increased demand for digital financial services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the US, companies that have taken the lead in these industries are Stripe, Affirm, Brex, Marqeta, among others. In the Latam region payments unit Mercado Pago from Mercado Libre, companies like Nubank, Creditas, d-local, Clip, Ual√°, Clara, and most recent ones like Pomelo are growing fast and in constant need of data analysis and modeling for problems like credit risk analysis, fraud detection, customer's churn prediction or behavioral models to predict untimely payments.  

Credit risk modeling is one of the most common uses of machine learning within this industry, whose goal is to use financial data to predict default risk. When a business or individual applies for a loan, the lender must evaluate whether the business can reliably repay the loan principal and interest. The machine learning model learns from data (such as firm information, financial statements, previous transactions, previous credit history, etc) and can accurately predict repayment probability for a given business loan applicant.

This type of solution has very wide applicability across not only fintech but also many business sectors and industries like logistics, banks, delivery apps, freight cargo companies, insurtech, etc. and could be easily adapted to any other "risk estimation" business challenges.
